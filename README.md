# AM-Modulator-Circuit-Design-and-Simulation
This project, developed for the Telecommunications Circuits course in collaboration with a teammate, involves designing and simulating two AM modulator circuits. The project includes circuit analysis, simulations in ADS and Proteus, practical implementation with oscilloscope measurements, and PCB design using Altium Designer.

Project Overview





Objective: Design and analyze two AM modulator circuits, simulate their performance, and validate results through practical implementation.



Circuits:





Circuit 1: Uses a single BC547 transistor to amplify the carrier signal and combine it with the message signal, followed by an LC filter (L=4700µH, C=2.2µF) to produce the AM signal.



Circuit 2: Employs two BC547 transistors—one as an oscillator to generate the carrier signal and another to modulate it with the message signal—followed by an LC filter.



Tasks:





Analyze circuit components (transistors, resistors, capacitors, LC filters) and their roles.



Simulate circuits in ADS and Proteus to verify AM modulation.



Implement the circuit practically and capture results using an oscilloscope.



Design a PCB layout for the AM modulator using Altium Designer.





Key Features





Circuit 1: Amplifies the carrier signal (( V_{in} )) using a BC547 transistor, combines it with the message signal (( V_m )) at the emitter, and filters the output with an LC circuit.



Circuit 2: Generates the carrier signal using an LC oscillator (L=47µH, C=2200pF) and modulates it with a second transistor.



Simulations: Performed in ADS and Proteus to validate circuit performance.



Practical Results: Oscilloscope measurements confirm AM signal generation.



PCB Design: Designed in Altium Designer for practical implementation.

Prerequisites





Advanced Design System (ADS) for RF simulation.



Proteus for circuit simulation.



Altium Designer for PCB design.



Oscilloscope for practical measurements.



Notes





Ensure simulation software (ADS, Proteus, Altium Designer) is installed.



Oscilloscope measurements require hardware setup as described in the report.



The project was completed in Fall/Winter 2024.
